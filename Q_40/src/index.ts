// This is "Ambreen",and you are watching the solution of the problem no 40 in typescript assignment.

// Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.\n
// The function should take in an artist name and an album title, \n
// and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information. \n
// Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. \n
// Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. \n
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. \n
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. \n
// Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
