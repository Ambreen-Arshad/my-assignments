// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. \n
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. \n
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. \n
// Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, \n
// such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information \n
// was stored correctly.
